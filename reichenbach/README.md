# WRITTEN PROBLEMS

  a] Using the permutation rule, and knowing that every person can only appear once, we have 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 10! = 3,6288,00 possible combinations
  b] Because we know that two people need to always stick close, we can consider the two of them as a unique choice when accounting for the number of possible combinations and multiply the total by 2, due to the fact that there is no imposed ordering in which the two man can sit, which means there are a total of 2*1 = 2 different combinations they can sit. Because of this, there are a total of (9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1)*2 = 9!*2 = 725,760 possibl combinations
  c] In order to respect the constraint, we just need to alernate our choice between the two groups, which we can eaily do as shown before by using the permutation rule and alternating the choice between the two groups. This means that there are 5*5*4*4*3*3*2*2*1*1 = 5!*5! = 14,400 posible combinations
  d] Using the same reasoning we did in answer b, we consider the various couples as a single entity, hence we are considering only a set of 5 elements. Using again the permutation rule, we have that there are a total of 5*4*3*2*1 = 5! = 120 possible combinations
